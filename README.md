# React Sticky Content
This project implements a sticky sidebar web component using React hooks. The sidebar element will stick to the top of the viewport when scrolling down, but will stop sticking when reaching the bottom of the content container.
## Features:
- Utilizes React hooks, including useState and useEffect, for managing the sidebar behavior.
- Calculates and sets the sidebar width and top position using the getBoundingClientRect() method.
- Adds or removes the CSS class sticky on the sidebar element based on the scroll position of the page.
- Handles scroll events to dynamically update the sticky behavior.
- Can be easily integrated into a larger web application as a reusable component.
## Usage
- Install dependencies by running npm install or yarn install.
- Import the StickySidebar component from this project into your React application.
- Include the StickySidebar component in your desired layout, and customize the sidebar and content container elements using CSS classes.
- Customize the behavior by adjusting the handleScroll function or component props, if needed.
- Enjoy a sticky sidebar that enhances your web application's user experience!
